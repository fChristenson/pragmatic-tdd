# Pragmatic TDD

## What we will cover

- Why you shouldn't treat TDD as a religion.
- How to be a responsible developer.

## Notes

TDD is a great practice.
Responsible developers value their test and understand that good tests help their work.
However as with everything there are some who go too far.

TDD is not a religion but some developer act as if there is a holy book of rules to follow.

In the real world there are methods of development that are better handled by other means than TDD.
