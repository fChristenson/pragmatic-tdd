# Pragmatic TDD

## What we will cover

- Why you shouldn't treat TDD as a religion.
- How to be a responsible developer.

## Notes

TDD is a great practice.
Responsible developers value their test and understand that good tests help their work.
However as with everything there are some who go too far.

TDD is not a religion but some developer act as if there is a holy book of rules to follow.

In the real world it is not always practical to use TDD.

The goal of any testing strategy is to give confidence that the code works at all times.
TDD is one way to help with that confidence but there are other methods as well.
